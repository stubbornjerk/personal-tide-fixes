# unique

I didn't alter much, I **just changed the colorway** and figured I'd put my version of the codes + tutorials here. If you want to assemble it yourself, follow 
their tutorial, it's actually pretty straightforward. I guess my takeaway is that they never really specify what they mean by "unique" across the site because I 
don't speak code.

What they really mean about that is that **it's like a username.** Ao3 doesn't tell you that if you use a common name for a site skin, **people can accidentally 
yoink it** from your list of site skins even if they can't edit or alter it.

So, make sure you're going to **name it something like "[username] tide dark" or "[username] tide phone"** because otherwise you're going to yoink someone else's code 
and chances are they did not use the same colorways as you. Just bear that in mind.

# colorway changes
If you're going to change the colorways on the light mode version, here's the colors you have to ctrl+f and replace yourself.

ElectricAlice's colors > My colors

  d84549 > 9645d8

  bd302a > a320bd

I put my colors there in case you grabbed my purple light version.

# font changes
 If you're going to change the main work font, **ctrl+f to "body,"** and change the font-family to whatever you want. just **make sure they're all 
 either sans or sans-serif.** This is just to change the font you're going to be reading most works in + tags, etc. **It won't affect work 
titles.**
