#remarks
  I didn't alter much, I just changed the colorway and figured I'd put my version of the codes + tutorials here. If you want to assemble it yourself, follow their tutorial, it's actually pretty straightforward. I guess my takeaway is that they never really specify what they mean by "unique" across the site because I don't speak code.
  I made specifications so it activates the skin based on if you have dark mode on your browser or not. I'm trying to improve my eye health so... I'll put that in a separate thing.

#unique titles
  What they really mean about that is that it's like a username. Ao3 doesn't tell you that if you use a common name for a site skin, people can accidentally yoink it from your list of site skins even if they can't edit or alter it.
  So, make sure you're going to name it something like "[username] tide dark" or "[username] tide phone" because otherwise you're going to yoink someone else's code and chances are they did not use the same colorways as you. Just bear that in mind.

#colorway changes
  If you're going to change the colorways on the light mode version, here's the colors you have to ctrl+f and replace yourself.
ElectricAlice's colors > My colors
  d84549 > 9645d8
  bd302a > a320bd
  e0878a > a887e0
  d1e9eb > de91eb
  eed8d9 > d9d8ee
  f0e6e6 > e6e6f0
  e14c74 > 7c44e1
I put my colors there in case you grabbed my purple light version.

#font changes
 If you're going to change the main work font, focus on this part of the code for both light and dark mode:

body,
input,
.toggled form,
.dynamic form,
.secondary,
.dropdown,
button,
blockquote,
.filters dt,
.filters dd,
.filters input[type=submit],
.filters .expander,
.bookmark .user .meta,
.datetime,
a.work,
span.symbol,
.splash .news .meta,
select {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}

Change that last part to whatever type face you want. This is just to change the font you're going to be reading most works in + tags, etc. It won't affect work titles.
